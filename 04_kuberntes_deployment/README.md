 Kubernetes (K8s) Basics

1. What is Kubernetes?
	‚Ä¢	Kubernetes = container orchestration platform.
	‚Ä¢	Think of it like an operating system for your containers.
	‚Ä¢	Instead of manually starting Docker containers, networking them, and restarting them when they fail ‚Üí Kubernetes does all that automatically.

2. Why do we need Kubernetes?

Without Kubernetes:
	‚Ä¢	You run Docker containers manually: docker run -p 8000:8000 my-app.
	‚Ä¢	If the container crashes, you must restart it.
	‚Ä¢	If traffic spikes, you must manually run more containers.
	‚Ä¢	Networking between containers (APIs, DBs) = messy.
	‚Ä¢	Deploying to multiple machines = painful.

With Kubernetes:
	‚Ä¢	It keeps your app alive (auto-restarts containers if they fail).
	‚Ä¢	It scales up/down containers based on traffic.
	‚Ä¢	It has a service mesh (built-in networking & service discovery).
	‚Ä¢	It manages secrets, configs, storage.
	‚Ä¢	It runs across clusters of servers ‚Üí looks like one machine.

| Component       | What it is                         | Why it‚Äôs needed                                   | Analogy                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Cluster**     | Whole Kubernetes system            | Runs and manages all workloads                   | The whole city         |
| **Node**        | A worker machine (VM/server)       | Provides compute/storage for Pods                 | A building             |
| **Pod**         | Smallest deployable unit           | Runs containers with networking/storage           | An apartment           |
| **Deployment**  | Controller for Pods                | Ensures desired replicas, self-healing, updates   | Blueprint for buildings|
| **Service**     | Stable network endpoint            | Load balances Pods, hides Pod IP changes          | Public entrance        |
| **Ingress**     | HTTP/HTTPS routing                 | Pretty URLs, external access to Services          | City gate & street signs|
| **ConfigMap**   | App config storage                 | Keeps configs separate from code                  | Instruction manual     |
| **Secret**      | Encrypted config storage           | Safely stores passwords, API keys                 | Safe with keys         |
| **Namespace**   | Logical grouping                   | Isolates dev/staging/prod resources               | District in the city   |


brew install --cask docker && brew install kubectl minikube

üîë The Order of Kubernetes Components
	1.	Cluster
	‚Ä¢	First you need a cluster (the whole environment).
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre using Minikube locally:
    . minikube start
	2.	Nodes
	‚Ä¢	A cluster is made of nodes (machines).
	‚Ä¢	When you create a cluster, Kubernetes already provisions nodes for you.
	‚Ä¢	In Minikube, it‚Äôs just 1 node (your laptop inside Docker/VM).
	‚Ä¢	On AWS/GCP/Azure, you can have many worker nodes.
	‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt usually create nodes manually ‚Äî Kubernetes/cloud does it.
    . kubectl get nodes

We‚Äôll create two YAML files:
	1.	deployment.yaml ‚Üí tells Kubernetes how to run Pods.
	2.	service.yaml ‚Üí exposes your Pods so you can reach them.


 Summary (deployment.yaml )
	‚Ä¢	apiVersion + kind: tells Kubernetes ‚Äúthis is a Deployment.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	metadata: gives it a name + labels.
	‚Ä¢	replicas: how many Pods (copies) to run.
	‚Ä¢	selector: tells Deployment which Pods belong to it.
	‚Ä¢	template: defines what each Pod looks like.
	‚Ä¢	containers: runs your Docker image.
	‚Ä¢	probes: health checks to restart or stop routing traffic if unresponsive.

 Summary (service.yaml )

    Line-by-line
	‚Ä¢	kind: Service ‚Üí We‚Äôre creating a Service resource.
	‚Ä¢	metadata.name ‚Üí Name = fastapi-service.
	‚Ä¢	selector.app=fastapi-app ‚Üí This Service connects to all Pods with that label.
	‚Ä¢	ports.port=8000 ‚Üí The Service will listen on port 8000.
	‚Ä¢	ports.targetPort=8000 ‚Üí Traffic goes into the Pod‚Äôs container port 8000.
	‚Ä¢	type: NodePort ‚Üí Makes it reachable outside the cluster on a high random port.

	You have a Deployment with 2 replicas (Pods).
	‚Ä¢	The Service (fastapi-service) load balances between them.
	‚Ä¢	Without Service ‚Üí you‚Äôd have to manually find Pod IPs each time (painful).
	‚Ä¢	With Service ‚Üí you always use fastapi-service:8000 inside the cluster, or a node/URL externally.

Cluster (Minikube)
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Node: minikube (your laptop/VM)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment: fastapi-deployment
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pods:
               - Pod1 (FastAPI + model)
               - Pod2 (FastAPI + model)


# üöÄ FastAPI on Kubernetes (Minikube)

This demo shows how to deploy a FastAPI ML app on Kubernetes using **Deployment**, **Service**, and **Ingress**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Docker
- Minikube
- kubectl

---

## üì¶ Step 1. Start Cluster
```bash
# Start local Kubernetes cluster
minikube start --driver=docker

# Verify cluster
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

# Deploy FastAPI App
# Apply Deployment (runs 2 replicas of FastAPI container)
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Check Deployment & Pods
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>

# Expose with Service

# Apply Service
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

# Check Services
kubectl get services

# Open Service in browser (NodePort URL)
minikube service fastapi-service --url

# (Alternative) Port-forward Service to localhost
kubectl port-forward service/fastapi-service 8080:8000

#Enable Ingress

# Enable ingress controller in Minikube
minikube addons enable ingress

# Apply Ingress resource
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

# Check Ingress
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress fastapi-ingress

# Get Minikube IP
minikube ip

#Test API

# Health check
curl http://fastapi.local/

# Prediction
curl -X POST http://fastapi.local/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features":[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2]}'
