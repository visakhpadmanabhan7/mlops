Perfect — let’s make your README not just a “project description” but also a mini-cheatsheet for GitHub Actions YAML syntax. That way, when you revise later, you’ll know exactly why each keyword exists.

Here’s an extended README.md for 01_cicd_pipeline/:

CI/CD Pipeline for ML Model 🚀

This folder demonstrates a basic ML CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
The pipeline is split into 4 jobs to mimic a real-world MLOps workflow: Build → Train → Deploy → Predict.

---

## 📂 Workflow Stages

### 🔹 1. Build
- Checks out the repository  
- Sets up Python  
- Installs dependencies  
- Runs placeholder tests (`echo "✅ Tests passed"`)  
✔ Ensures the project is healthy before training  

---

### 🔹 2. Train
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** model on the Iris dataset (`train.py`)  
- Saves the model as `artifacts/model.pkl`  
- Uploads the model as a GitHub Actions **artifact**  
✔ Produces a reusable model file  

---

### 🔹 3. Deploy
- Downloads the `trained-model` artifact  
- Prepares the runtime environment (Python + dependencies)  
- Verifies that the model file exists (`ls -lh ./model`)  
✔ Simulates deployment (model ready for production)  

---

### 🔹 4. Predict
- Downloads the `trained-model` artifact again  
- Loads the model using `joblib`  
- Runs a test prediction on a sample Iris input:  

```python
sample = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # Iris-setosa
pred = model.predict(sample)
print(pred)  # Expected output: [0]
```


## 🛠 GitHub Actions Keywords Cheat Sheet

| Keyword   | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `name`    | Label for the workflow or step (shows in Actions UI) | `name: ML CI/CD Pipeline` |
| `on`      | Defines triggers (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.) | `on: push: branches: ["ci_cd"]` |
| `jobs`    | Groups steps into units of work; each job runs on a fresh VM | `jobs: build:` |
| `runs-on` | Defines the runner environment (Ubuntu, Windows, Mac) | `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` |
| `steps`   | Ordered tasks inside a job | `steps: - name: Checkout repo` |
| `uses`    | Calls a prebuilt GitHub Action (reusable automation) | `uses: actions/checkout@v4` |
| `with`    | Passes input parameters to an Action | `with: python-version: "3.10"` |
| `run`     | Executes shell commands directly | `run: python train.py` |
| `path`    | Defines where to save or fetch files (used with artifacts) | `path: ./model` |
| `needs`   | Defines job dependencies (ensures order) | `needs: train` |
| `env`     | Set environment variables | `env: VAR_NAME: value` |
| `secrets` | Securely reference sensitive values (API keys, passwords) | `${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}` |

📌 Next Steps
	•	Add unit tests for data preprocessing & training
	•	Extend Deploy to containerize the model with Docker
	•	Deploy to Kubernetes in the next stage of the project
